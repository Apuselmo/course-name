### **2. The Catechist as a Herald of Hope**
A catechist is more than a teacher; they are a *witness* and *missionary disciple* who transmits not just doctrines but *the living encounter with Christ*. Pope Francis, in *Catechesi Tradendae*, emphasizes that catechesis must "bring the warmth of hope" (*Evangelii Gaudium* 275).  

The catechist’s mission is to:
- **Proclaim the Gospel** (kerygma) – announcing Christ’s death and resurrection as the source of hope.
- **Form disciples** – helping others grow in faith, rooted in God’s promises.
- **Accompany seekers** – walking with them through doubts and struggles, always pointing toward Christ.
