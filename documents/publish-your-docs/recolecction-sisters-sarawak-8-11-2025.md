# You are Beauty
## Recollection for Sisters Franciscan of Sarawak

### 1 Introduction
As following the series of Recollections that Franciscan Sisters of Sarawak already scheduled, we are excited to share our thoughts on the beauty of God, in nature, human, and self, as St. Francis of Assisi lives with it. Knowledge is power, and we believe that understanding the beauty of God, nature, human, and self can empower us to live a more fulfilling life. For this reason, we invite you to join us in this journey of discovery and reflection. We'll start first with God's beauty. In trying to understand God's beauty, we will explore the beauty of God in nature, human, and self.
