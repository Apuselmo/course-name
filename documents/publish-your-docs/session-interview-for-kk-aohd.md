6. **Preferential Option for the Poor** (Fr. Raphael OFMCap)

**Scripture**:

- **Matthew 25:31–46** – “Whatever you did for one of the least of these... you did for me.”
- **Proverbs 31:8–9** – “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

**Church Teaching**:

- **Evangelii Gaudium (No. 198)** – “The poor must be privileged recipients of the Gospel... and we must not fail to recognize that they have much to teach us.”

**Questions**:

- How does this principle challenge our pastoral priorities?
- What does “*preferential*” look like in liturgy, outreach, or resource allocation?
- What symbolic gestures or liturgical practices help communities embody this principle?
- How can this principle be expressed visually or symbolically in parish materials?
- How does this principle challenge the Church to prioritize the needs of the vulnerable?
- What does a “*preferential option*” look like in your local context?
- How do we make the poor the heart of our pastoral vision and mission?
