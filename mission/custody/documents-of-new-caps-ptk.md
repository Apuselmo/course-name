Waiting for the arrival of documents of 2 capuchins from pontianak.

In the meantime focus with the extension process.

The two priests that will come are Fr. Benedetto Benno OFMCap and Fr. Diego OFMCap from Pontianak Capuchin Province.

They already responded 'ok' to this new assignment of mission in helping Malaysian Capuchin Custody, and in that way helping our presence (capuchin) by helping Sibu Diocese in various ministries.
