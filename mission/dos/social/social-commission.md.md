º After talk with SR, now she realised the things that lingered in the system event in this religious entity or community like this Diocese.
> - talking on Justice and Creation (Creation Justice Idea)
> - talking on stateless and child-labour issue.
> - talking on creation only - deforestry? monocultural?
> º SR will pay a visit to the Myanmar lady at Stapang in this Saturday. Hoping that all is well and will be well, while SR must taking action for collecting informations and documents that should support the process that will be taken.
º In all, what we had been discussed about actually the issues that residing and lingered in this diocese’s system. All as if clear, but actually not transparent. All full of irony and politics. So we just can taking an action and taking our side in facing this un-liking reality.

The more we involve with this ‘company’, the more we could see how they play on the ground, and ask us to play on an un-even ground.

> [!INFO] I purposely call **it** as **Company**, since I myself felt it was as if like that. Really a bit hard to express but that’s the reality indeed. For knowing the true things and the very true reality of this ‘company’ - as saying - we need to work in and to be involve in first.

There are so many un-efficient doing and action here in these diocese and parishes because of sentiments on race and grouping by some ppl with their own needs and thinking. 

> [!INFO] For now on, as long as I can, I will try to do the best to meet the needs of the diocese. But how if most of them don’t care?
